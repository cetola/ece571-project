Open the project in QuestaSim and simulate the "sd_controller_top_tb" module and run.

I am working to change only "sdModel.sv" and "sd_controller_top.sv" as we want to vaidate that the behavior of the SD Card 
remains the same as I modify it

All modules in this folder originated from https://opencores.org/project,sdcard_mass_storage_controller

sdModel.sv and sd_controller_top_tb.sv were modified to take advantage of SystemVerilog constructs

Interfaces.sv was created by Alec Wiese using code from project partners
